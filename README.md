# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these are mine.

This is a rough first draft, structure and bootstrapping shall come
with time.

## Install

Run this:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/BPScott/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles && script/bootstrap

On OSX XCode Developer Tools must be installed first.

## Going Further

### OSX

* Import misc/colorschemes/monokai.itermcolors into iTerm2
