# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these are mine.

This is a rough first draft, structure and bootstrapping shall come
with time.

## Install

Run this:

    git clone https://github.com/BPScott/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    script/bootstrap

On OSX XCode Developer Tools must be installed first.

## Going Further

### OSX

* Import misc/colorschemes/monokai.itermcolors into iTerm2

### Ubuntu

* Copy XFCE-Terminal color config into its location

        cp ~/.dotfiles/misc/colorschemes/terminalrc ~/.config/Terminal/terminalrc
